				<br><a><h3>ACTION</h3></a>
				<p>In some instances, it's fights with bare knuckles, firearms, and/or non-firearm weapons such as swords and blades and whatever the imagination can come up with. In other instances, action is expressed through sci-fi and there are those where the mystic arts or some form of the supernatural is applied.</p>

				<a><h3>ROMANCE</h3></a>
				<p>The focus of these shows is the romantic relationships between the characters as well as their blooming love with one another. You'll often find romance anime tightly tied with the shoujo subgenre, but it also works pretty well with comedy, harem, and drama.</p>

				<a><h3>ADVENTURE</h3></a>
				<p>Adventure is something that creeps into just about any anime. ... Going on the adventure could be physical in that the characters move around, but it also can be, and frequently is, a journey of self discovery and development.</p>
